# Cars24_used_cars_data_analysis_python

In this Python project, we conducted web scraping on Cars24 to gather data on used cars from five different cities: Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai. We extracted information such as Car Name, Model, Gear, Price, EMI, Location, and Features by identifying HTML tags and class names. Afterward, we carried out feature engineering to extract specific attributes like Car Brand and Model Year from the Car Name field and Driven (Kms), Ownership, and Fuel from the Features field. Subsequently, we cleaned the data using regular expressions and saved it in a CSV file. Finally, we conducted data analysis on the dataset to derive insights from the collected information.
